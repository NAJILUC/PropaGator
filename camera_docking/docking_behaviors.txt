Docking Behaviors

Assumptions:
    -Boat will be facing signs, will be mostly perpendicular relative to the signs
    -Boat has been given the two desired signs

Steps
    1) Are any signs visible?
        -NO
            -drive forward 1 meter
        -YES
            -go to to step 2
    2) Are all three signs visible?
        -NO
            -wait until all three are visible (1 sec)
            a) is the first desired sign visible?
                -NO
                    -drive forward .5 meter
                    -return to step 2
                -YES
                    -proceed to step 3

    3) Is the desired sign in the center of the camera's FOV?
        -NO
            -adjust left/right until desired target is within the center x-vals
            -repeat step 3
        -YES
            -drive forward 1 meter ||OR|| LIDAR detects nearest object is < *some_distance
