Azi Planner
===========

This planner is not inherently associated with the Propagator project.


# Things to try
- Parameterize a spline in point-position and velocities, then generate a cost that describes the length of the trajectory, then try to optimize
-- > Local minima are _fine_, *a solution* is what we care about. Any non-ridiculous solution that is within bounds
